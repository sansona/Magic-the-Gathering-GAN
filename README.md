# Magic-the-Gathering-GAN

This is a collection of notebooks applying ```fastai``` & ```pytorch``` to some datasets for Magic: The Gathering (MTGAN). These are unpolished models and primarily done for demonstrative purposes.

Notebooks included are:
1. Language model: a language model based off ULMFiT for generating new MTG text data. Accuracy of 84%.
2. Text to Color Classifier: a RNN-based multilabel classifier for predicting color identities based off text data. Accuracy of 95%.
2. Art Classifier: a CNN that classifies card art based off the color identity. Accuracy of 94%
